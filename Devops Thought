Five levels
Values :
	CAMS: Culture, Automation, Measure, Share. Lean
Principals
  Three ways developed by autor of the phoenix project
	Systems thinking: focus on entire value chain dont over optimize. Concept to cash.
	Amplyfing feedback: short effective loop, dev to op,  bug reporting worst is by customer. 
	Culture of continious experimentation and learning.
Methods
	People over process over tools.
	Continious delivery
	Lean management: small batches, feedback loop, visualization
	Change control: eliminate fragile artifacts, repeatable build process, manage dependecies, continious improvement.	                
	IAC: System treated like cattle not pets, code review, tested, managed programabily.
Practices:
	Incident command system.
	Developers on call.
	Status pages. eg azure serices down. mitigation documented. 
	Embedded teams
	the cloud: api driven infra
	Blue/Green deployment.
	Chaos Monkey.
Tools:
you choose



	replaces the model where different teams do different work. 
	operations teams use the same techniques as developers 
	Eevery asset is checked in and have tests associated with it.


why do you care
deploy faster, fail less recover faster.
lean management and continious delivery help deliver values faster.
reduces unplanned work.
